            <h1>About me</h1>
            <div>My full name is Lucas Brennand Barbosa Chiaperini. I was born in the USA but have been living my entire life in Brasil. I'm currently a student studying at the Catholic University of Pernambuco (UNICAP). I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I am looking to graduate in 2025. I'm searching to become either a front-end or fullstack developer and everyday I aim to improve my skills!</div>

            <div class="experience">
                <h2>Notecenterpe</h2>
            I started my work journey in 2022 with a small company owned by a single computer technician. He taught me
            everything about fixing and repairing computers and laptops, and I'm very grateful for this experience as it
            showed me that I wanted to pursue a career in technology.
        </div>
        <div class="experience">
            <h2>L'ure Aromas</h2>
            In 2023, a cosmetics company asked for me to be their stock manager. I was in charge of controlling and
            administrating all the products and was responsible for overseeing all the invoices. It was a change of pace
            from my area, but it allowed me to work with a real company and see what day to day was like.
        </div>
        <div class="experience">
            <h2>Pro-criança</h2>
            At the start of the first half of 2024, as an extension project of my university, I had to work with a
            non-profit organization called Pro-criança (Pro-child). It's a mentorship dedicated to helping children and
            young teens in poor financial situations. My team's goal was to perform maintenance on the Pro-crianças's
            website and add new functions.
